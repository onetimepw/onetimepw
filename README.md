# OneTimePW

OneTimePW is an easy-to-use self-hosted service for secure password and other sensitive information sharing.

# Why do I need OneTimePW?

When you share sensitive information like passwords via email or chat, it is stored as is in the recipient's mailbox or chat history.
This poses a security risk.

OneTimePW solves this problem by allowing you to share sensitive information securely.
The information is encrypted and deleted after it is viewed once.

The recipient receives a link to the information, which can be viewed only once.
After the information is viewed, it is deleted from memory.

That's it! No more worrying about sensitive information being stored in email or chat history.

## Demo

You can try out OneTimePW at <https://onetimepw.ru>

### How can I verify that the server is the same version as on GitHub?

You can check the version of the server by sending a GET request to the `/health/check` endpoint.

```bash
{
  "release": "11154621569",
  "results": [
    {
      "checker": "service",
      "status": true
    },
    {
      "checker": "redis",
      "status": true
    }
  ],
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": 2418,
  "version": "bd4d0da538ade40a9450defbeb394d6aa910a507"
}
```

The `version` field contains the commit hash, `release` contains the workflow run id, ex from above:
<https://github.com/onetimepw/onetimepw/actions/runs/11154621569>
<https://github.com/onetimepw/onetimepw/commit/bd4d0da538ade40a9450defbeb394d6aa910a507>


## üîß How to Install

### üê≥ Docker compose

docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:6.2
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:6379:6379
    volumes:
      - ./redis_data:/data
    command: redis-server --requirepass someRedisPass
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD", "redis-cli", "ping" ]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 2s
      retries: 5

  app:
    image: ghcr.io/onetimepw/onetimepw:master
    restart: always
    stop_signal: SIGINT
    environment:
      - GOMAXPROCS=1
    depends_on:
      - redis
    volumes:
      - ./config.yml:/app/config.yml
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:8080:8080
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "20"

volumes:
  redis_data:
```
config.yml:
```yaml
env: "prod"
port: 8080
redis:
  addr: "redis://:someRedisPass@redis:6379"
  name_space: "onetimesecret"
```
OneTimePW is now running on <http://127.0.0.1:8080>

Now you can set up a reverse proxy like Nginx/Caddy/Traefik to serve the application over HTTPS.

## Motivation
- I was looking for a self-hosted service to securely share sensitive information, but I couldn't find one that was easy to use and looked simple. I found a few services that did this, but they were either too complicated to set up or didn't appeal to me (and they were written in Ruby)
- Try to deploy with github actions
- Why not?

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ‚≠ê.
