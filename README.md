# OneTimePW

OneTimePW is an easy-to-use self-hosted service for secure password and other sensitive information sharing.

# Why do I need OneTimePW?

When you share sensitive information like passwords via email or chat, it is stored as is in the recipient's mailbox or chat history.
This poses a security risk.

OneTimePW solves this problem by allowing you to share sensitive information securely.
The information is encrypted and deleted after it is viewed once.

The recipient receives a link to the information, which can be viewed only once.
After the information is viewed, it is deleted from memory.

That's it! No more worrying about sensitive information being stored in email or chat history.
